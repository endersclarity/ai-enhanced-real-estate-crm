# Staging Test Report

## Executive Summary

The staging instance is running and core functionality works, but there are database schema inconsistencies between the code expectations and actual database structure.

## Test Results

### ✅ Working Features (9/19 tests passed)
- Homepage loads correctly
- Client management (list, add new, quick add)
- CRPA Dashboard 
- Static assets (CSS/JS)
- 404 error handling
- Basic routing

### ❌ Failed Features (10/19 tests failed)
- Properties & Transactions pages (column name mismatches)
- API endpoints not implemented (/api/stats, /api/health)
- Dashboard route missing (/dashboard returns 404)
- Security headers not configured

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database Schema Mismatches
The code expects `street_address` but the database has `address`:
- Properties table: Has `address` column, code looks for `street_address`
- Transactions queries: Join on `p.street_address` fails

### 2. Missing API Routes
These endpoints return 404 because they're not implemented:
- `/api/stats`
- `/api/health` 
- `/dashboard`

### 3. Environment Differences
- Dev environment has been manually patched
- Staging uses clean database from migrations
- No automated schema migration system

## Deployment Readiness

**Current Status: NOT READY for production deployment**

### Required Fixes Before Deployment:
1. **Database migrations** - Standardize column names
2. **API implementation** - Add missing endpoints
3. **Security headers** - Configure proper headers
4. **Error handling** - Better 500 error pages

### What Works Well:
- Docker containerization
- Environment separation (dev/staging)
- Core CRM functionality
- Quick add client feature
- CRPA dashboard

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Create database migration scripts
2. **Short-term**: Implement missing API endpoints
3. **Long-term**: Add automated testing to CI/CD

## Test Commands

```bash
# Full test suite
./run_staging_tests.sh

# Quick diagnostics
python3 test_staging_quick.py

# Check logs
docker logs offer-creator-staging --tail 50
```
