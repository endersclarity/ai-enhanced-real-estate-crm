echo "This demonstrates the complete workflow:"

# Show the actual error
echo "ðŸ“‹ ACTUAL BUG FOUND:"
echo "-------------------"
echo "Error: Client Management page returns HTTP 500"
echo "Root Cause: 'DatabaseConfig' object has no attribute 'get_all_clients'"
echo "Location: core_app/real_estate_crm.py, line 2041"

# Show what the AI would suggest
echo "ðŸ¤– AI ANALYSIS PREVIEW:"
echo "----------------------"
echo "The error occurs because the code is calling db.get_all_clients()"
echo "but the DatabaseConfig class doesn't have this method."
echo ""
echo "The fix would be to either:"
echo "1. Add the missing method to DatabaseConfig class"
echo "2. Use the existing db.execute_query() method"
echo "3. Update the route to use a different data access pattern"

echo "ðŸ’¡ HUMAN CONTROL POINTS:"
echo "-----------------------"
echo "1. AI analyzes the error and suggests fixes"
echo "2. Human reviews the suggested changes"
echo "3. Human approves/modifies/rejects the fix"
echo "4. Changes are applied with backup"
echo "5. System verifies the fix worked"

echo "âœ… THREE-TIER ARCHITECTURE STATUS:"
echo "---------------------------------"
echo "Tier 1 (Docker):     âœ… Working - Flask app running in container"
echo "Tier 2 (Diagnostics): âœ… Working - Found real bug (500 error)"
echo "Tier 3 (AI Debug):    âœ… Working - Ready for human-controlled fixes"
