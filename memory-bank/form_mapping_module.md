# Module: Form Mapping

## Purpose & Responsibility
Manages the mapping between client data inputs and specific PDF form fields across all California real estate disclosure documents. Provides data transformation, field validation, and mapping configuration management.

## Interfaces
* `FormMapper`: Data mapping and transformation
  * `map_client_data()`: Transform input to form fields
  * `validate_mappings()`: Verify field compatibility
  * `get_form_schema()`: Retrieve form field definitions
* Input: Raw client data, form identification
* Output: Mapped field data, validation results

## Implementation Details
* Files:
  * `form_mapper.py` - Core mapping logic and transformations
  * `form_data_mapping.json` - Configuration file with field mappings
  * `analyze_forms.py` - Form analysis and field detection utilities
* Important algorithms:
  * Dynamic field mapping based on form type
  * Data validation against California real estate requirements
  * Fallback mapping for missing or changed form fields
* Data Models
  * `FieldMapping`: Individual field transformation rules
  * `FormSchema`: Complete form field definitions and validation rules

## Current Implementation Status
* Completed: Basic mapping configuration, form analysis tools
* In Progress: Dynamic mapping improvements, validation rules
* Pending: Comprehensive field coverage, error handling

## Implementation Plans & Tasks
* `implementation_plan_mapping_accuracy.md`
  * Complete field mapping for all 13 disclosure forms
  * Implement comprehensive validation rules
* `implementation_plan_mapping_maintenance.md`
  * Automated form change detection
  * Configuration update workflows
