**Last Updated**: 2025-06-09

## 1. Overall Project Vision & Goals
*   Deliver production-ready real estate CRM with AI-powered form automation that eliminates manual form filling errors and reduces transaction time from hours to minutes
*   Activate existing $50,000+ form processing infrastructure with proper CRM integration and user-friendly workflows
*   Provide reliable, scalable system with automated diagnostics and AI-assisted troubleshooting capabilities

## 2. Major Project Phases / Epics

### Phase/Epic: Critical System Remediation
*   **Description**: Resolve database schema mismatches, JavaScript dependency conflicts, and enhanced architecture integration failures that are preventing system functionality
*   **Status**: In Progress (Immediate Priority)
*   **Key Objectives**:
    *   Fix database schema inconsistencies between init scripts and actual database
    *   Restore enhanced CRM architecture functionality
    *   Resolve JavaScript dependency conflicts (Bootstrap 5 + jQuery)
    *   Implement user-friendly interfaces replacing memorized ID requirements
*   **Primary HDTA Links**:

*   **Notes/Key Deliverables for this Phase/Epic**:
    *   Functional CRM with consistent database schema
    *   Working enhanced architecture integration
    *   Restored user confidence in system reliability

### Phase/Epic: Form Processing Activation
*   **Description**: Activate existing professional-grade form processing infrastructure with proper CRM integration and user workflows
*   **Status**: Planned (Depends on System Remediation completion)
*   **Key Objectives**:
    *   Integrate professional form filler with corrected CRM database
    *   Create form generation API endpoints and user interface components
    *   Implement multi-format output (PDF, HTML, validation reports)
    *   Enable California Residential Purchase Agreement generation workflow
*   **Primary HDTA Links**: 
    *   `implementation_plan_form_integration_activation.md`
*   **Notes/Key Deliverables for this Phase/Epic**:
    *   Working CRPA generation with CRM data population
    *   User-friendly form generation workflow
    *   Multi-format output for copy-paste integration with ZipForms

### Phase/Epic: AI Integration Enhancement
*   **Description**: Expand AI capabilities to include natural language form generation and enhanced CRM operations
*   **Status**: Partially Completed (Core AI working, needs form integration)
*   **Key Objectives**:
    *   Integrate AI with form processing module for natural language requests
    *   Enhance AI tools for comprehensive real estate operations
    *   Implement advanced email processing and entity extraction
*   **Primary HDTA Links**: 
    *   `implementation_plan_ai_form_generation.md`
*   **Notes/Key Deliverables for this Phase/Epic**:
    *   \"Generate purchase agreement for client X property Y\" functionality
    *   Enhanced AI-assisted CRM operations
    *   Natural language query capabilities

### Phase/Epic: Production Deployment & Monitoring
*   **Description**: Deploy production-ready system with comprehensive monitoring, security hardening, and performance optimization
*   **Status**: Initial Planning
*   **Key Objectives**:
    *   PostgreSQL migration from SQLite for production scalability
    *   SSL certificate management and security hardening
    *   Integration of three-tier diagnostics with production monitoring
    *   Automated backup and disaster recovery systems
*   **Primary HDTA Links**: 
    *   `implementation_plan_production_deployment.md`
*   **Notes/Key Deliverables for this Phase/Epic**:
    *   Production-grade deployment with automated monitoring

## 4. Key Project-Wide Milestones
*   **System Restoration**: Database and architecture issues resolved - Status: In Progress (Priority 1)
*   **Form Generation MVP**: Basic CRPA generation working end-to-end - Status: Planned (Depends on remediation)
*   **AI Form Integration**: Natural language form requests functional - Status: Planned
*   **Production Launch**: Fully deployed system with monitoring - Status: Planned

## 5. Overall Project Notes / Strategic Considerations
*   **Critical Success Factor**: Resolving current system failures is prerequisite to all other work - user confidence must be restored
*   **Business Value**: Existing form processing infrastructure represents significant investment that needs activation
*   **Technical Debt**: Enhanced architecture integration failures indicate need for systematic dependency management
*   **User Experience**: Natural language interfaces and copy-paste workflows are essential for user adoption
*   **Reliability**: Three-tier diagnostics system provides foundation for production reliability and user confidence
