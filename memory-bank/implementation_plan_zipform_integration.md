# Implementation Plan: ZipForm Plus Integration & PDF Reconstruction

**Parent Module(s)**: [pdf_engine_module.md], [form_mapping_module.md]
**Status**: [x] In Progress

## 1. Objective / Goal
Integrate support for flattened ZipForm Plus downloads by implementing advanced PDF reconstruction capabilities that rebuild form fields from scratch, enabling seamless population of previously non-fillable forms.

## 2. Affected Components / Files
* **Code:**
  * `advanced_pdf_reconstructor.py` - Multi-strategy PDF reconstruction system
  * `pdf_field_reconstructor.py` - Basic field reconstruction framework  
  * `intelligent_pdf_filler.py` - Smart analysis-based filling
  * `professional_pdf_filler.py` - Clean overlay and calibration system
  * `zipform_field_mapper.py` - ZipForm-specific field mapping
* **Documentation:**
  * `README.md` - Updated with ZipForm workflow
  * `ARCHITECTURE.md` - PDF processing architecture
* **Data Structures / Schemas:**
  * Field mapping configurations for CA real estate forms
  * Coordinate-based positioning templates

## 3. High-Level Approach / Design Decisions
* **Approach:** Multi-strategy reconstruction supporting template-based, text analysis, and complete rebuild methods
* **Design Decisions:**
  * Template-based reconstruction: Use predefined field layouts for known form types
  * Text analysis reconstruction: Automatically detect field locations by analyzing document text patterns
  * Complete rebuild: Reconstruct PDFs from scratch with proper form field structures
  * Professional overlay: Precise coordinate-based text placement with calibration tools
* **Algorithms:**
  * `PDF Structure Analysis`: Extracts form fields, text patterns, and layout information
  * `Field Position Detection`: Identifies optimal placement locations for form data
  * `Template Matching`: Maps CSV data to appropriate form field locations

## 4. Task Decomposition (Roadmap Steps)
* [x] [Create PDF Reconstruction Framework](advanced_pdf_reconstructor.py): Multi-strategy reconstruction system
* [x] [Implement Template-Based Reconstruction](pdf_field_reconstructor.py): Predefined field layout system
* [x] [Build Intelligent Analysis System](intelligent_pdf_filler.py): Smart form field detection
* [x] [Develop Professional Overlay System](professional_pdf_filler.py): Precise coordinate-based filling
* [x] [Create ZipForm Field Mapper](zipform_field_mapper.py): CA real estate form specific mapping
* [ ] [Implement Calibration Tools](calibration_system): Visual coordinate adjustment interface
* [ ] [Add Batch Processing Support](batch_processor): Process multiple ZipForm downloads
* [ ] [Create Form Type Auto-Detection](form_detector): Automatically identify CA real estate forms
