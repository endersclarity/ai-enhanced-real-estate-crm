# Implementation Plan: Critical Database Schema Remediation

**Parent Module(s)**: [crm_core_module.md]
**Status**: [x] Proposed / [ ] Planned / [ ] In Progress / [ ] Completed / [ ] Deferred

## 1. Objective / Goal
Resolve critical database schema mismatches between `init_database.py` and the actual database structure that are preventing the enhanced CRM architecture from functioning properly. Ensure database consistency and restore system functionality.

## 2. Affected Components / Files
*   **Code:**
    *   `core_app/init_database.py` - Database initialization script with incorrect schema
    *   `core_app/database/real_estate_crm_schema.sql` - SQL schema definition file
    *   `database_config.py` - Database connection configuration
    *   `core_app/crm_data_mapper.py` - Enhanced architecture data mapping
*   **Documentation:**
    *   `activeContext.md` - Current system status and critical issues
    *   `memory-bank/crm_core_module.md` - Module documentation updates
*   **Data Structures / Schemas:**
    *   SQLite database tables and field definitions
    *   177-field CRM schema alignment

## 3. High-Level Approach / Design Decisions
*   **Approach:** Systematic schema analysis, correction, and validation with data preservation
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   Preserve existing data during schema corrections
    *   Use schema migration approach rather than destructive rebuild
    *   Implement validation checks to prevent future schema drift
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   Schema comparison and diff analysis
    *   Safe migration with rollback capability
*   **Data Flow:**
    *   Current schema analysis → Schema correction → Data migration → Validation testing

## 4. Task Decomposition (Roadmap Steps)
*   [ ] [Analyze Current Schema](memory-bank/task_analyze_schema.md): Compare init_database.py against actual database structure
*   [ ] [Create Migration Script](memory-bank/task_create_migration.md): Build safe schema correction migration
*   [ ] [Update Enhanced Architecture](memory-bank/task_update_architecture.md): Fix CrmDataMapper to work with corrected schema
*   [ ] [Validate System Integration](memory-bank/task_validate_integration.md): Test complete system functionality

## 5. Task Sequence / Build Order
1.  Analyze Current Schema - *Reason: Must understand exact differences before proceeding*
2.  Create Migration Script - *Reason: Need safe migration path before making changes*
3.  Update Enhanced Architecture - *Reason: Can fix mapping after schema is corrected*
4.  Validate System Integration - *Reason: Final verification after all components updated*

## 6. Prioritization within Sequence
*   Analyze Current Schema: P1 (Critical Path - blocks all other work)
*   Create Migration Script: P1 (Critical Path)
*   Update Enhanced Architecture: P1 (Required for system functionality)
*   Validate System Integration: P2 (Verification step)

## 7. Open Questions / Risks
*   Risk: Data loss during schema migration if not properly handled
*   Risk: Enhanced architecture may have additional dependencies beyond schema issues
*   Question: Should we implement automated schema validation to prevent future drift?
*   Question: Are there other components affected by schema changes beyond CrmDataMapper?
