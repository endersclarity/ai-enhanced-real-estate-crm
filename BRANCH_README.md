# Branch: feature/cloud-deployment

## Purpose
Complete architectural migration from local SQLite to production cloud infrastructure using DigitalOcean hosting and Supabase PostgreSQL database, transforming the Real Estate CRM into a scalable, cloud-native application.

## Success Criteria
1. **DigitalOcean Deployment**: CRM successfully deployed and accessible via production URL
2. **Supabase Database Migration**: Complete 177-field schema migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL  
3. **Environment Configuration**: Secure secrets management and environment variable setup
4. **Performance Validation**: Cloud deployment meets or exceeds local performance benchmarks
5. **Production Readiness**: SSL certificates, monitoring, backups, and security hardening

## Timeline
- **Day 1**: Supabase setup, database schema migration, connection testing
- **Day 2**: DigitalOcean deployment, environment configuration, domain setup  
- **Day 3**: Performance optimization, security hardening, production validation

## Technical Goals
- **Database Migration**: SQLite → Supabase PostgreSQL with zero data loss
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated deployment scripts and configuration
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple concurrent users and transactions
- **Security**: Production-grade authentication, HTTPS, and data protection
- **Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring and error tracking
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated database backups and disaster recovery

## User Experience Target
Narissa and her team can access the Real Estate CRM from anywhere with enterprise-grade reliability, performance, and security. The cloud deployment provides seamless multi-user access with real-time collaboration capabilities.

This addresses the core need: **Professional cloud hosting with enterprise reliability for real estate business operations**

## Architecture Migration

### From (Current Local)
- **Database**: SQLite file-based storage
- **Hosting**: Local development server (port 5001)
- **Environment**: Single-user development setup
- **Storage**: Local file system

### To (Target Cloud)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities
- **Hosting**: DigitalOcean App Platform with auto-scaling
- **Environment**: Multi-user production with environment separation
- **Storage**: Cloud storage with CDN integration

## Key Dependencies
- ✅ **Current CRM Foundation**: Working Flask app with AI integration
- ✅ **DigitalOcean Account**: Cloud hosting platform ready
- ✅ **Supabase Account**: Database-as-a-service configured
- ✅ **Domain Configuration**: DNS and SSL certificate setup
- ⏳ **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management needed

## Risk Mitigation
- **Database Backup**: Full SQLite export before migration
- **Staged Deployment**: Dev → Staging → Production pipeline
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain local development environment
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing before go-live
- **Security Audit**: Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment
