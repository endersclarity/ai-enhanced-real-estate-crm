- **Accuracy Tests**: 95% minimum for data extraction across diverse email formats
- **Edge Case Testing**: Malformed emails, missing data, conflicting information

## Technical Architecture

### AI Processing Pipeline
```
Email Input → Content Parsing → Entity Extraction → Data Mapping → CRM Population
     ↓              ↓                ↓              ↓             ↓
   Validation → Preprocessing → NLP Analysis → Field Mapping → Database Update
```

### Key Technologies
- **NLP Framework**: spaCy or NLTK for natural language processing
- **Email Processing**: Python email library and IMAP integration
- **Pattern Recognition**: Custom patterns for real estate data extraction
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy for database operations
- **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints for external email systems

### Data Flow
1. **Email Ingestion**: Receive emails via IMAP or API
2. **Content Analysis**: Extract text content and identify key information
3. **Entity Recognition**: Identify clients, properties, dates, amounts, etc.
4. **Field Mapping**: Map extracted entities to CRM database fields
5. **Validation**: Verify data quality and flag potential issues
6. **Database Update**: Populate CRM with extracted and validated data
7. **Notification**: Alert users of new data and required actions
