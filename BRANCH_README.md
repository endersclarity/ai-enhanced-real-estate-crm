# Branch: feature/phase-2-ai-integration (PIVOTED)

## Purpose **[PIVOTED TO AI-CENTRIC APPROACH]**
Transform the real estate CRM into an AI-powered assistant that intelligently manages database operations through natural conversation. Instead of rigid email processing, create a smart AI agent that can understand context and perform any CRM operation through conversational commands.

## Success Criteria **[UPDATED - AI-CENTRIC]**
- [ ] **AI Database Assistant**: Smart agent that can create, read, update clients/properties through conversation
- [ ] **Conversational CRM Operations**: Natural language commands for all database operations
- [ ] **Intelligent Decision Making**: AI suggests actions and asks clarifying questions
- [ ] **Flexible Workflow**: Handle any real estate scenario, not just email processing
- [ ] **Context Awareness**: AI understands real estate domain and CRM relationships

## Scope & Deliverables **[PIVOTED]**

### AI Database Assistant Core
- **Smart Flask Backend**: AI-callable database functions for all CRM operations
- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language commands for client/property management
- **Intelligent Context**: AI understands real estate workflows and suggests actions
- **Flexible Operations**: Handle any CRM scenario through conversation

### AI-Callable CRM Functions
- **Client Management**: `create_client()`, `update_client()`, `find_client()`, `merge_clients()`
- **Property Operations**: `add_property()`, `update_listing()`, `schedule_showing()`
- **Transaction Workflow**: `create_transaction()`, `update_status()`, `generate_documents()`
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI recommends next steps based on conversation context

### Conversational Workflow Examples
- **Email Processing**: "Here's an email from John..." → AI: "I see contact info, want me to create a client?"
- **Property Updates**: "Update 123 Main St price to $500k" → AI: "Updated! Want me to notify interested clients?"
- **Transaction Management**: "Close escrow for Johnson property" → AI: "Closing escrow, generating final docs..."
- **Data Discovery**: "Find all clients interested in downtown condos" → AI: "Found 12 matches, here's the list..."

### AI-Enhanced Capabilities
- **Context Awareness**: Understands real estate domain and CRM relationships
- **Smart Suggestions**: Recommends actions based on conversation and data analysis
- **Conflict Resolution**: Asks clarifying questions when data conflicts arise
- **Workflow Intelligence**: Suggests next steps in real estate processes
