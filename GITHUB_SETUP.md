# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create the GitHub Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Set repository name: `ai-enhanced-real-estate-crm`
3. Set description: `AI-Enhanced Real Estate CRM with intelligent email processing, automated data extraction, and comprehensive client management. Features AI-powered chatbot, PDF form automation, and 177-field CRM schema for real estate professionals.`
4. Make it **Public** (for template use)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /home/ender/.claude/projects/offer-creator

# Add the GitHub remote (replace 'ender' with your actual GitHub username if different)
git remote add origin https://github.com/ender/ai-enhanced-real-estate-crm.git

# Push the current branch with all commits
git push -u origin feature/phase-2-ai-integration

# Create and push main branch from current state
git checkout -b main
git push -u origin main

# Switch back to feature branch if you want to continue development
git checkout feature/phase-2-ai-integration
```

## Step 3: Set Default Branch (Optional)

If you want `main` to be the default branch:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click Settings → Branches
3. Change default branch from `feature/phase-2-ai-integration` to `main`
