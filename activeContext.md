# 🏠 AI-Enhanced Real Estate CRM - Active Context

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-07T16:30:00Z  
**Session Status**: 🚧 ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT - Form Extraction & Recreation System  
**Current Branch**: `main` (preparing new feature branch)

## 🎯 CURRENT FOCUS: FORM EXTRACTION & RECREATION SYSTEM

### 📋 Project Discovery: Massive Existing Form Infrastructure Found
**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: This project contains extensive, production-ready form processing work that was previously built:

- ✅ **Complete CRPA System**: 33-field California Residential Purchase Agreement template with coordinate mappings
- ✅ **Professional PDF Tools**: `professional_form_filler.py` with ReportLab coordinate-based filling
- ✅ **HTML Form Replicas**: Pixel-perfect recreations in `html_templates/true_crpa_form.html`
- ✅ **177-Field CRM Integration**: Complete mappings between database and form fields
- ✅ **All 13 CAR Forms**: Already analyzed and processed in `car_forms_analysis.json`
- ✅ **Validation Framework**: Legal compliance and business rule validation system
- ✅ **Multiple Strategies**: PDF coordinate filling, HTML recreation, bespoke form creation

### 🎯 Current Objective
Create a production system that generates visually accurate, fully populated form replicas that Narissa can use as copy-paste reference alongside official CAR forms on ZipForms. Split-screen workflow: our populated form on right, ZipForms on left, copy-paste field by field.
