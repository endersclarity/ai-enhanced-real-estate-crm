# Two-Stage Autonomous Setup Complete ✅

## What You Now Have:

### 1. **Two Docker Instances** (Simple and Clean)
- **`offer-creator-dev`** (port 5001) - For fucking around and testing
- **`offer-creator-staging`** (port 5002) - Clean, ready to deploy

### 2. **Autonomous Testing** (Until Completely Confident)
- Runs tests repeatedly until 95% confidence threshold
- Automatic iteration with structured JSON output
- Smart failure detection and analysis

### 3. **Simple Commands**

#### Basic Management:
```bash
# Start/stop instances
./scripts/two-stage-manager.sh start
./scripts/two-stage-manager.sh stop
./scripts/two-stage-manager.sh status

# View logs
./scripts/two-stage-manager.sh logs-dev
./scripts/two-stage-manager.sh logs-staging

# Get shell access
./scripts/two-stage-manager.sh shell-dev
```

#### Autonomous Testing:
```bash
# Test dev until confident (up to 10 iterations)
./scripts/claude-test-runner.sh dev

# Run full pipeline: dev → staging → ready
./scripts/claude-test-runner.sh pipeline

# Check if dev is ready and auto-promote
./scripts/claude-test-runner.sh promote
```

#### Manual Operations:
```bash
# Manually promote dev to staging
./scripts/two-stage-manager.sh promote

# Deploy staging to DigitalOcean
./scripts/deploy-to-digitalocean.sh
```

## Workflow:

1. **Develop in `dev`** - Make changes, test features
2. **Run autonomous tests** - `./scripts/claude-test-runner.sh dev`
3. **When confident, promote** - Automatically or manually
4. **Test staging** - Final validation
5. **Deploy to DigitalOcean** - When staging is perfect

## Example Session:

```bash
# Start your day
./scripts/two-stage-manager.sh start

# Fuck around in dev, add features
./scripts/two-stage-manager.sh shell-dev
# ... make changes ...

# Test until confident
./scripts/claude-test-runner.sh dev

# If tests pass, run full pipeline
./scripts/claude-test-runner.sh pipeline

# Deploy when ready
./scripts/deploy-to-digitalocean.sh
```

## For Claude Code:

I can now run autonomous tests and analyze the JSON output:
```bash
./scripts/claude-test-runner.sh dev
```

The output tells me:
- Confidence score (0-1)
- Test results (passed/failed)
- Critical failures
- Whether it's ready for promotion
- What action to take next

This achieves the "until completely confident" philosophy without overcomplicating your setup.
