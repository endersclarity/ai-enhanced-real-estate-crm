# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Secure Environment Variable Loading
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a secure method for loading database credentials and other sensitive configuration from environment variables.
# Details:
Use a library like `python-dotenv` for local development environment variable loading from a `.env` file (excluded from version control). For production on DigitalOcean, configure the App Platform to provide these variables securely. Update the Flask app configuration to read these variables upon startup.

# Test Strategy:
Configure environment variables (or a `.env` file) with Supabase credentials. Run the Flask app and verify that it successfully reads the credentials from the environment and connects to the database without hardcoding secrets.
