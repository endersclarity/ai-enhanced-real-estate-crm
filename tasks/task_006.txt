# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Update documentation to reflect the new AI-native entity extraction system, fallback mechanism, validation layer, and enhanced error handling.
# Details:
Update the system architecture documentation and developer guides. Describe the removal of regex dependencies, the implementation of direct function calling, the AI-native extraction process, the fallback logic (Task 2), the Python-side validation (Task 4), and the tiered error handling/clarification workflow (Task 5). Include examples of how the system handles different inputs and errors.

# Test Strategy:
Review the updated documentation to ensure it accurately reflects the implemented system changes and provides clear guidance for developers and understanding for stakeholders.
