# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Role-Based Authorization System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a role-based authorization system to control user access to different CRM features and data.
# Details:
Define user roles (e.g., Admin, Agent, Manager) and associate permissions with each role. Implement logic within the application to check user roles and permissions before allowing access to specific routes, data, or actions. Ensure data protection is enforced based on user roles.

# Test Strategy:
Create users with different roles. Log in as each user type and verify they can only access features and data allowed by their role. Attempt to access restricted areas and confirm access is denied.
