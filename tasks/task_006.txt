# Title: Implement Real-time Data Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement real-time data validation logic for the extracted entities based on the 177-field CRM schema and potential conflicts.
# Details:
Add JavaScript logic to validate the format and potential consistency of the entities extracted in Task 5 against the expected data types and constraints of the 177-field CRM schema. Include basic checks for data conflicts if possible at this stage.

# Test Strategy:
Test the validation logic with extracted data containing valid formats, invalid formats, and potentially conflicting information. Verify that validation rules are applied correctly and issues are flagged.
