      "description": "Replace the regex-based parsing logic in `analyze_response_for_functions()` and the `/chat` endpoint with direct processing of function call results provided by LangChain's Gemini integration.",
      "details": "Modify the `/chat` endpoint in `real_estate_crm.py` (lines 1216-1327) to remove dependencies on `analyze_response_for_functions()` (lines 310-348). Instead, directly utilize the structured function call output from the LangChain/Gemini integration to identify and execute CRM operations. Ensure the system correctly interprets and uses parameters provided by the AI.",

      "details": "Rename the existing `extract_entities_from_text()` function to `extract_entities_from_text_legacy()`. Implement logic within the entity extraction process to attempt calling the AI-native extraction first. If this fails (e.g., API error, malformed AI response), catch the error and attempt extraction using `extract_entities_from_text_legacy()`. Log instances where the fallback is used.",
      "testStrategy": "Simulate scenarios where the AI extraction might fail (e.g., mock an API error) and verify that the system correctly falls back to using the legacy regex function.

Validate data types (e.g., ensure budget is a number), formats (e.g., email structure, phone number length/format), and check for basic business constraints (e.g., required fields for creating a client).

Implement specific error handling for different failure types: AI API errors, AI extraction/parsing errors, validation errors from Task 4, and database errors (e.g., constraint violations). For validation errors or ambiguous requests, formulate a clarifying question to send back to the user via the chat interface. Log detailed error information on the backend.",

When the AI proposes a database operation (e.g., 'Create Client', 'Update Property'), display the details of the proposed change to the user. The user must click a 'Confirm' button (or similar) for the operation to proceed.
