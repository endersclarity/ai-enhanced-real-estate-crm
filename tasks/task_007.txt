# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop User Interface Components for Form Selection and Preview
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the user interface components within the existing dashboard that allow users (Narissa) to select a client and property from the CRM, choose one of the 13 CAR forms, preview the populated form, and confirm generation.
# Details:
Create UI elements: dropdowns or lists to select client and property (leveraging existing CRM UI components), a list or gallery of the 13 CAR forms for selection. Add a button to trigger population (calling the backend endpoint from Task 6). Implement a PDF viewer component to display the generated form for preview. Include a confirmation step before finalization/saving.

# Test Strategy:
Manually test the UI flow: select client, select property, select form, click populate. Verify that the preview displays the generated PDF correctly. Test selecting different forms and data combinations.
