# Task ID: 7
# Title: Connect Frontend Chat to Flask Chat Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the refactored chatbot JavaScript to send user chat messages to the new Flask `/chat` endpoint and display the responses received from the backend.
# Details:
In the JavaScript code integrated into `templates/crm_dashboard.html`, modify the function that handles sending user messages. Use the `fetch` API or `XMLHttpRequest` to send a POST request containing the user's message to the `/chat` endpoint defined in `real_estate_crm.py`. Upon receiving a response from the backend, update the chat interface to display the AI's message.

# Test Strategy:
Load the dashboard. Type a message in the chatbot sidebar and send it. Use browser developer tools (Network tab) to verify that a POST request is sent to `/chat`. Verify that the response from the backend is received and the AI's message appears in the chat interface.
