# Title: Create Data Preview Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a preview interface to display the extracted and validated data to the user before it is populated into the CRM.
# Details:
Design and implement a UI component within chatbot-crm.html that presents the entities extracted (Task 5) and validated (Task 6) in a clear, organized format. The preview should allow the user to review the data before proceeding.
