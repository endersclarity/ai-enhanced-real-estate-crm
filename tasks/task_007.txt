# Task ID: 7
# Title: Connect Sidebar Frontend to Flask Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Connect the chatbot sidebar JavaScript in `crm_dashboard.html` to the Flask backend endpoints (`/chat`, `/process_email`) to enable real-time communication.
# Details:
Modify the JavaScript in `templates/crm_dashboard.html`. Replace the current demo/fallback logic with AJAX calls to send user input from the chat and email processing areas to the `/chat` and `/process_email` Flask endpoints. Implement handlers for receiving responses from the backend and updating the sidebar UI (displaying AI responses, processing results, errors). Include frontend error handling for network issues.

# Test Strategy:
Open the dashboard in a browser. Type messages into the chatbot sidebar and paste email content into the processing area. Verify that these actions trigger AJAX requests to the correct backend endpoints and that the responses from the backend are correctly displayed in the sidebar UI. Test basic chat interactions and email processing initiation.
