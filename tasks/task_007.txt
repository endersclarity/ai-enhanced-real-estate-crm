# Task ID: 7
# Title: Prepare Application for DigitalOcean Deployment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Prepare the Flask application for deployment on DigitalOcean App Platform.
# Details:
Create necessary files for DigitalOcean App Platform, such as a `Dockerfile` or `Procfile`, specifying how the application should be built and run. Ensure all dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Configure the application to listen on the port specified by the hosting environment (typically via an environment variable like `PORT`).

# Test Strategy:
Build the Docker image locally using the Dockerfile or test the Procfile command. Ensure the application starts correctly and listens on the configured port.
