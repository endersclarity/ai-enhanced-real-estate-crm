# Task ID: 12
# Title: Conduct Performance Testing and Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct performance testing and optimize the application and database.
# Details:
Perform load testing on the deployed application to simulate multiple concurrent users and transactions as per scalability goals. Identify performance bottlenecks in the application code or database queries. Optimize queries, add indexes, or refactor code as needed to meet or exceed local performance benchmarks.

# Test Strategy:
Run load tests using tools like ApacheBench, JMeter, or Locust. Analyze results for response times, error rates, and resource utilization. Compare cloud performance metrics against local benchmarks.
