# Task ID: 3
# Title: Refine AI Prompts with Few-Shot Examples
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refine prompts for Gemini 2.5 Flash using few-shot examples to improve the accuracy and consistency of AI-native entity extraction and function parameter identification, especially for edge cases.
# Details:
Update the system prompts or user messages sent to the Gemini API via LangChain. Include specific examples of user inputs and the desired structured output (JSON for entities, function call parameters) to guide the AI. Focus on known failure cases and complex inputs. Ensure `temperature=0.1` is used for deterministic responses.

# Test Strategy:
Create a test suite with various edge cases and complex natural language inputs. Run these inputs through the updated AI extraction process and verify that the AI consistently and accurately extracts the correct entities and identifies the appropriate function calls and parameters based on the few-shot examples.
