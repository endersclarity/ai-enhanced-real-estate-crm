# Task ID: 3
# Title: Deploy Flask Application to Production Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Deploy the Flask CRM application (`real_estate_crm.py`) to the configured cloud hosting environment.
# Details:
Set up a production-grade web server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI) to serve the Flask application. Configure the web server to interface with the Flask app. Deploy the application code, including all dependencies. Configure environment variables for database connection and other settings. Ensure the application can connect to the production PostgreSQL database.

# Test Strategy:
Access the application's root URL via HTTP (initially). Verify the application loads without errors. Check application logs for connection issues to the database or other services.
