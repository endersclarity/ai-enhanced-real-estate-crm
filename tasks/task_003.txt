# Task ID: 3
# Title: Refactor Chatbot JavaScript for Dashboard Context
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the JavaScript code from `chatbot-crm.html` to function correctly within the `templates/crm_dashboard.html` context, addressing potential ID conflicts and ensuring event listeners are attached correctly.
# Details:
Identify all JavaScript code blocks and external script includes used by `chatbot-crm.html`. Consolidate or include these scripts in `templates/crm_dashboard.html`. Update any JavaScript code that relies on specific DOM element IDs or classes to ensure they correctly target elements within the new sidebar structure. Use more robust selectors if necessary. Ensure event listeners (e.g., button clicks, input changes, paste events) are correctly attached to the elements in the dashboard DOM.

# Test Strategy:
Load `templates/crm_dashboard.html` in a browser. Open the browser's developer console and check for JavaScript errors. Interact with the chatbot sidebar elements (type text, click buttons, paste content) and verify that basic JavaScript functions (like reading input, showing/hiding elements) execute without errors, even if backend communication is not yet functional.
