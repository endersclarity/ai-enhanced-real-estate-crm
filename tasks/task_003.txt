# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the mechanism to load and integrate the designed AI instructions into the existing chatbot-crm.html interface.
# Details:
Modify chatbot-crm.html to load the AI instruction framework designed in Task 2. Ensure the chatbot logic can access and utilize this context to inform its responses and processing capabilities. This should be a browser-based implementation leveraging enhanced HTML/JavaScript.
