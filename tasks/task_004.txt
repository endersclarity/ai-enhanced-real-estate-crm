# Task ID: 4
# Title: Import Data into Supabase PostgreSQL
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Import the exported data from SQLite into the new Supabase PostgreSQL database.
# Details:
Use PostgreSQL's `psql` command-line tool, Supabase's data import features, or a custom script to load the data from the exported files into the corresponding tables in the Supabase database. Handle potential data type mismatches or constraints during import.

# Test Strategy:
After import, query key tables in the Supabase database to verify that the data has been imported correctly and completely. Compare row counts and sample data with the original SQLite database.
