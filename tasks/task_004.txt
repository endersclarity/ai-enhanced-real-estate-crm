# Task ID: 4
# Title: Add Python-Side Data Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Add a validation layer in the Flask backend to check the data extracted by the AI for correctness, format, and basic business logic before attempting database operations.
# Details:
Implement validation logic in `real_estate_crm.py` after receiving extracted entities or function call parameters from the AI. Validate data types (e.g., ensure budget is a number), formats (e.g., email structure, phone number length/format), and check for basic business constraints (e.g., required fields for creating a client). Use Pydantic or similar validation methods.

# Test Strategy:
Test with inputs designed to produce potentially invalid or malformed data from the AI (e.g., 'create client John Doe with budget ABC'). Verify that the validation layer correctly identifies the invalid data, prevents the database operation, and prepares an appropriate error response.
