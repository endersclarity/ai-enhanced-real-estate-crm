# Task ID: 4
# Title: Define Flask Endpoints for Chatbot Interaction and Data Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Add new routes in `real_estate_crm.py` to handle incoming requests from the integrated chatbot for both chat interactions and processed email data.
# Details:
In `real_estate_crm.py`, define a new Flask route, e.g., `/chat`, that accepts POST requests containing user messages. Define another new route, e.g., `/process_email`, that accepts POST requests containing the extracted data from the email processing module. These endpoints should initially just receive and log the data to confirm connectivity.

# Test Strategy:
Run the Flask application. Use `curl` or a tool like Postman to send POST requests to the newly defined `/chat` and `/process_email` URLs with sample data (e.g., JSON payload). Verify that the Flask application logs or prints the received data, confirming the endpoints are active and receiving requests correctly.
