# Task ID: 4
# Title: Configure Custom Domain and SSL Certificates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure the custom domain for the application and install SSL certificates for secure HTTPS access.
# Details:
Update DNS records (A/CNAME) with the domain registrar to point to the cloud hosting server/load balancer IP. Obtain SSL certificates (e.g., Let's Encrypt, commercial CA). Configure the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or load balancer to use the SSL certificates and enforce HTTPS redirection for all traffic. Ensure the custom domain is secured with SSL as per success criteria.

# Test Strategy:
Access the application using the custom domain name via HTTPS. Verify the SSL certificate is valid and trusted by browsers. Check that HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS.
