# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Automated Form Population Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core engine responsible for taking CRM data records (client, property, transaction) and a selected blank form template, applying the field mapping, and populating the form fields using PDF libraries.
# Details:
Create a function or class that accepts CRM data (as a dictionary or object) and a form template identifier. Load the corresponding blank template and the field mapping. Iterate through the form fields identified in Task 2. For each form field, look up the corresponding CRM field(s) using the mapping from Task 3. Retrieve the data from the provided CRM record. Use `PyPDF2` or `reportlab` to write the data into the appropriate field coordinates/locations on the blank PDF template. Handle different field types (text, checkboxes).

# Test Strategy:
Create mock CRM data records. Select a few form templates. Run the population engine with mock data and templates. Verify that the output PDF contains the mock data correctly placed in the expected fields. Check different data types and lengths.
