# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Data Backup and Restore Capabilities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement capabilities for securely backing up and restoring the production database.
# Details:
Ensure automated database backups (configured in Task 2) are functioning correctly. Develop or configure a process for manually triggering backups. Implement a procedure and potentially tools for restoring the database from a backup in case of data loss or corruption. Store backups securely and off-site if possible.

# Test Strategy:
Perform a manual backup of the production database. Test the restore process in a staging or development environment using a recent backup file. Verify that the restored data is consistent and complete.
