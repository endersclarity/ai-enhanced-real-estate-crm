# Task ID: 10
# Title: Final Testing, Optimization, and Production Readiness
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct comprehensive testing across all integrated components, optimize performance, and ensure the unified interface is production-ready for Narissa Realty operations.
# Details:
Execute all testing requirements outlined in the PRD: Functional Testing (chatbot, email processing, CRM integration), Email Processing Tests (95%+ accuracy with diverse emails), CRM Integration Tests (reliable 177-field population), User Experience Tests (<30s workflow), and Edge Case Testing (malformed data, conflicts). Use sample data (`simple_client_spreadsheet.csv`). Measure performance targets (processing speed <10s, UX workflow <30s, response time <5s, data quality >90%). Address any bugs or performance bottlenecks. Ensure secure handling of API keys and sensitive data. Update documentation.

# Test Strategy:
Follow the detailed test plan derived from the PRD's testing requirements and performance targets. Use a checklist to ensure all criteria are met. Conduct testing on target devices/browsers. Monitor application logs and performance metrics during testing. Get user feedback on the integrated workflow.
