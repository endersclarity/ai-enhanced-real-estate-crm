# Task ID: 10
# Title: Setup Application Performance Monitoring and Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate application performance monitoring (APM) and logging solutions.
# Details:
Choose and integrate an APM tool (e.g., Sentry, Datadog, or DigitalOcean's built-in metrics) to monitor application performance, errors, and request latency. Configure application logging to output to a centralized logging service or standard output that DigitalOcean can capture.

# Test Strategy:
Generate some traffic to the deployed application. Check the APM dashboard for performance data and error reports. Verify that application logs are being captured and are accessible.
