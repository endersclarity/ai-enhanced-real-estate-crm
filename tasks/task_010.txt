# Task ID: 10
# Title: End-to-End Testing and Refinement
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of the entire form population workflow, from user request (UI or AI) to generated PDF output. This includes testing with various CRM data sets, different forms, and handling edge cases like missing data.
# Details:
Execute test cases covering all 13 forms, using diverse CRM data (complete, partial, edge cases). Test both UI-driven and AI-driven form generation requests. Verify form accuracy (100% field population for available data), processing speed (<5 seconds), and error handling (graceful handling of missing data, clear feedback). Address any bugs or performance issues found.

# Test Strategy:
Develop a suite of end-to-end test cases. Execute tests systematically, comparing generated PDFs against expected outputs. Measure processing time. Log and track errors. Verify user feedback for errors is clear and actionable.
