# Task ID: 10
# Title: Comprehensive Testing and Production Readiness
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the integrated system, covering user workflows, error handling, performance, and responsive design, and validate against all success criteria.
# Details:
Execute automated test suites (`test_ai_entity_extraction.py`, `test_complete_workflow.html`, etc.) covering AI extraction, validation, error handling, and the full chat-confirm-update-refresh workflow. Manually test the system on different devices and screen sizes to ensure responsive design. Simulate various error conditions and network issues. Benchmark performance against the defined targets (<5s chat response, <2s DB ops, <3s dashboard updates, <15s full workflow). Address any remaining bugs and prepare the application for production deployment (security checks, configuration).

# Test Strategy:
Verify all automated tests pass. Confirm successful completion of all user workflows on desktop, tablet, and mobile. Validate that error handling provides clear feedback. Measure performance metrics and confirm they meet targets. Review the application against all success criteria listed in the PRD and branch context.
