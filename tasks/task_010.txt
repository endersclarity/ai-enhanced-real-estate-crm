# Task ID: 10
# Title: Integrate Full Email Processing Workflow and Optimize
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate all components (paste, extraction, validation, preview, mapping, conflict resolution, population) into a seamless workflow and optimize for performance and user experience.
# Details:
Connect the UI (Task 4, 7) and logic components (Task 5, 6, 8, 9) to create a single, fluid workflow from pasting an email to populating the CRM. Optimize the JavaScript code and UI interactions to achieve the performance targets: email analysis/extraction <10 seconds, full workflow <30 seconds, chatbot response <5 seconds.

# Test Strategy:
Perform end-to-end functional tests using sample real estate emails. Measure the time taken for email analysis/extraction and the complete workflow from paste to CRM population. Verify data accuracy (90%+ field population accuracy) in the localStorage CRM after population. Confirm the user experience is seamless and meets the <30 second target.
