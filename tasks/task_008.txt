# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop CRM Field Mapping and Population Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the integration layer to automatically map extracted entities to the corresponding fields in the localStorage-based 177-field CRM schema and prepare for population.
# Details:
Write JavaScript code to map the validated entities from Task 6 to the specific fields within the localStorage-based 177-field CRM schema. Implement the logic to structure this data for storage in localStorage.

# Test Strategy:
Test the mapping logic with sample extracted data. Verify that entities are correctly mapped to the intended fields in the 177-field schema structure before actual storage.
