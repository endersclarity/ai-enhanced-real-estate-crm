# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement User Confirmation Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a user confirmation workflow in the dashboard sidebar for all database operations proposed by the AI, requiring explicit user approval before execution.
# Details:
Design and implement a modal dialog or a clear UI element within the sidebar. When the AI proposes a database operation (e.g., 'Create Client', 'Update Property'), display the details of the proposed change to the user. The user must click a 'Confirm' button (or similar) for the operation to proceed. Implement the backend logic to support this two-step process (propose -> await confirmation -> execute upon confirmation). Allow users to cancel or potentially modify the proposed operation.

# Test Strategy:
Initiate various database operations via the chatbot (e.g., 'create client Jane Doe', 'update John Smith's phone number'). Verify that a confirmation prompt appears in the sidebar displaying the details of the proposed change. Test confirming the operation (verifying it executes) and canceling the operation (verifying it does not execute). Test the modification flow if implemented.
