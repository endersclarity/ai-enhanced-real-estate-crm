# Task ID: 8
# Title: Connect Frontend Email Processing to Flask Data Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the refactored chatbot JavaScript to send the extracted email data to the new Flask `/process_email` endpoint after processing and handle the backend's response.
# Details:
In the JavaScript code integrated into `templates/crm_dashboard.html`, modify the function that handles the output of the email processing and entity extraction. After the data is extracted and validated (and potentially previewed), use the `fetch` API or `XMLHttpRequest` to send a POST request containing the extracted data (likely as a JSON object) to the `/process_email` endpoint defined in `real_estate_crm.py`. Handle the response from the backend, displaying success messages, errors, or conflict resolution prompts to the user.

# Test Strategy:
Load the dashboard. Paste sample email content into the email processing area. Trigger the processing and data extraction. Verify that a POST request is sent to `/process_email` with the extracted data payload. Verify that the backend's response is received and handled appropriately in the frontend UI (e.g., a 'Data saved successfully' message).
