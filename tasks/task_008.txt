# Title: Deploy Flask Application to DigitalOcean
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Deploy the prepared Flask application to the DigitalOcean App Platform.
# Details:
Connect the application's code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to DigitalOcean App Platform. Configure the App Platform service, pointing it to the correct branch and build/run commands defined in Task 7. Configure environment variables securely within the DigitalOcean dashboard using the values from Task 6. Initiate the deployment.

# Test Strategy:
Monitor the deployment logs on DigitalOcean. Verify that the build and deployment complete successfully without errors. Access the application using the temporary DigitalOcean URL to confirm it is running.
