# Task ID: 8
# Title: Integrate with AI Chatbot for Natural Language Requests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the existing AI chatbot (Gemini 2.5 Flash via LangChain) to understand natural language requests for form generation, such as 'Generate a purchase agreement for John Smith and 123 Main Street'.
# Details:
Modify the LangChain agent or add a new tool/function specifically for form generation. Train or configure the AI to identify intent (form generation) and extract key entities (client name, property address, form type) from user prompts. Map extracted entities to CRM records and form identifiers. Call the backend form population endpoint (Task 6) with the identified parameters. The chatbot should respond with confirmation and potentially a link to the generated form.

# Test Strategy:
Interact with the chatbot using various natural language requests for form generation. Verify that the AI correctly identifies the intent, extracts entities, and triggers the form population process via the backend API. Check responses for clarity and accuracy.
