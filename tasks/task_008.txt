# Task ID: 8
# Title: Setup Production Monitoring and Error Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up production monitoring, logging, and error tracking systems for the deployed application and infrastructure.
# Details:
Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, CloudWatch, built-in provider tools) to track server resource usage (CPU, memory, disk), network traffic, and application metrics. Set up centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack, cloud provider logs). Integrate an error tracking service (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) to capture and report application errors in real-time.

# Test Strategy:
Verify monitoring dashboards display relevant metrics. Check that application logs are being collected. Introduce a test error in the application code and confirm it is captured and reported by the error tracking service.
