# Description: Perform security hardening and conduct a basic security audit.
# Details:
Review application code for common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). Ensure secure authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place. Configure firewall rules on DigitalOcean and Supabase. Review Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies if applicable. Conduct basic penetration testing or vulnerability scanning.
