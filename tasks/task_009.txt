# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Real-time Dashboard Updates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement functionality to ensure that changes made to the CRM database via the chatbot (Tasks 6 & 8) are reflected in the main dashboard view in near real-time.
# Details:
Add JavaScript to `templates/crm_dashboard.html` to periodically fetch updated data from the Flask backend relevant to the currently displayed CRM view (e.g., client list, property details). Update the relevant parts of the dashboard HTML dynamically with the new data. Alternatively, after a successful data save/update via the `/process_email` endpoint (Task 8), trigger a targeted refresh of the affected dashboard component or a full page reload if necessary (though targeted updates are preferred for better UX).

# Test Strategy:
Load the dashboard. Use the chatbot's email processing to add or update a client or property. Observe the main CRM dashboard view. Verify that the changes made via the chatbot appear in the dashboard without manual refresh within a short timeframe. Test updating data via the standard CRM interface and ensure the chatbot sidebar doesn't interfere.
