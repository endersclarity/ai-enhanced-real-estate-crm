# Title: Configure Domain and SSL on DigitalOcean
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure the custom domain and set up SSL certificates for the deployed application on DigitalOcean.
# Details:
In the DigitalOcean App Platform settings, add the custom domain. Update DNS records (A or CNAME) with the domain provider to point to the DigitalOcean App Platform service. DigitalOcean automatically provisions and manages Let's Encrypt SSL certificates. Ensure HTTPS redirection is enabled.

# Test Strategy:
Access the application using the custom domain name. Verify that the site loads correctly and that the connection is secure (HTTPS) with a valid SSL certificate.
