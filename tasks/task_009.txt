# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Conflict Resolution Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the logic and interface for resolving conflicts when extracted data potentially overwrites or conflicts with existing data in the localStorage CRM.
# Details:
Add JavaScript logic to detect potential data conflicts when attempting to populate the CRM (Task 8) with data that might exist in localStorage. Design a simple interface or mechanism to allow the user to review and resolve these conflicts (e.g., keep existing, use new, merge).

# Test Strategy:
Test the conflict resolution system with sample data that is known to conflict with existing entries in localStorage. Verify that conflicts are detected and the resolution mechanism functions as expected.
