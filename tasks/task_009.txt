# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Real-time Dashboard Updates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement functionality to automatically update or refresh relevant sections of the main dashboard interface after a database operation is successfully executed via the chatbot.
# Details:
After a confirmed database operation is completed by the backend (e.g., client created, property updated), trigger a frontend event or AJAX call to refresh the specific dashboard components that display the affected data (e.g., client list, property details). This ensures the main dashboard view is immediately synchronized with changes made via the chatbot.

# Test Strategy:
Use the chatbot to perform database operations that affect data displayed in the main dashboard area (e.g., create a new client, update an existing property). After confirming and executing the operation, verify that the relevant list or detail view in the main dashboard updates automatically and immediately without a manual page refresh.
