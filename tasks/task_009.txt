# Task ID: 9
# Title: Integrate Form Population into CRM Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the developed multi-form support backend (Task 6) and UI components (Task 7) seamlessly into the existing CRM dashboard architecture.
# Details:
Incorporate the UI components into the relevant sections of the CRM dashboard (e.g., client or property detail pages). Ensure smooth navigation and data flow between existing CRM features and the new form population functionality. Configure routing and state management within the dashboard application to support the new feature.

# Test Strategy:
Navigate through the CRM dashboard. Access the new form population feature from different entry points (e.g., client profile, property listing). Verify that the UI loads correctly and interacts properly with the backend within the integrated environment.
