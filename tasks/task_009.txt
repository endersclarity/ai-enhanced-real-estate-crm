# Task ID: 9
# Title: Perform Performance Optimization and Load Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Analyze and optimize application and database performance to meet the specified response time criteria (<1s response, <200ms queries).
# Details:
Use monitoring data and profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in the Flask application and PostgreSQL queries. Optimize database queries (indexing, query tuning). Optimize application code for efficiency. Conduct load testing using tools (e.g., JMeter, Locust) to simulate user traffic and measure response times under load. Iterate on optimizations until performance criteria are met.

# Test Strategy:
Measure response times for key application actions under normal and simulated load. Verify database query execution times are within the <200ms target. Confirm overall system response time is <1 second under expected load.
