# Task ID: 2
# Title: Analyze CAR Forms and Create Templates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Analyze the 13 CAR forms from attachments.zip to identify all fillable fields. Extract field names, types, and coordinates/positions within each PDF. Create blank, fillable template files for each form type.
# Details:
Use `pdfplumber` or `PyPDF2` to open each of the 13 PDF forms. Iterate through form fields to extract names and bounding boxes/coordinates. Document the identified fields for each form. Create a process or script to generate a 'blank' template version of each form, potentially by clearing existing field values or storing field locations for later population. Store templates and field data in a structured format (e.g., JSON, database table).

# Test Strategy:
Generate a report listing all identified fields for each of the 13 forms, including their extracted properties. Manually verify a sample of fields against the original PDFs. Ensure blank templates are created successfully.
