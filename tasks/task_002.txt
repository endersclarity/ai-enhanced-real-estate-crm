# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement AI Extraction Fallback System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a robust fallback mechanism for entity extraction, using the legacy regex method only if the primary AI-native extraction fails or is unavailable.
# Details:
Rename the existing `extract_entities_from_text()` function to `extract_entities_from_text_legacy()`. Implement logic within the entity extraction process to attempt calling the AI-native extraction first. If this fails (e.g., API error, malformed AI response), catch the error and attempt extraction using `extract_entities_from_text_legacy()`. Log instances where the fallback is used.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate scenarios where the AI extraction might fail (e.g., mock an API error) and verify that the system correctly falls back to using the legacy regex function. Test inputs that were previously handled by the regex to ensure the fallback is functional and produces expected results.
