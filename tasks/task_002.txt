# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure Production PostgreSQL Database
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Deploy and configure a production-ready PostgreSQL database instance on the cloud platform, including setting up automated backups.
# Details:
Set up a managed PostgreSQL database service or install PostgreSQL on a dedicated server/container within the cloud environment. Use the provided `real_estate_crm_schema.sql` to create the database schema. Configure user accounts and permissions securely. Implement automated daily backups to a separate storage location or service. Ensure the database is accessible from the application hosting environment.

# Test Strategy:
Connect to the database remotely using psql or a client tool. Verify schema is correctly applied. Test database user authentication. Confirm backup automation is scheduled and can be manually triggered.
