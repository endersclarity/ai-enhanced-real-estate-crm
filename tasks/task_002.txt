# Task ID: 2
# Title: Integrate Chatbot HTML/CSS into Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the HTML structure and CSS styles of the existing `chatbot-crm.html` into `templates/crm_dashboard.html` to create a sidebar component.
# Details:
Analyze `chatbot-crm.html` to identify core HTML elements for the chat interface and email processing area. Copy these elements into `templates/crm_dashboard.html`, placing them within a new sidebar container element (e.g., a `div`). Copy or adapt the relevant CSS rules from `chatbot-crm.html` or its associated stylesheets into the dashboard's CSS to style the sidebar appropriately. Ensure responsive design principles are maintained.

# Test Strategy:
Load `templates/crm_dashboard.html` in a web browser. Visually inspect that the chatbot interface appears as a sidebar on the dashboard page. Check responsiveness on different screen sizes. Use browser developer tools to inspect HTML structure and applied CSS rules.
