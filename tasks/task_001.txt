# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Development Environment and Branch
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the development environment is correctly set up and the feature branch `feature/ai-chatbot-dashboard-integration` is active and up-to-date.
# Details:
Verify Python environment with Flask and necessary libraries installed. Confirm access to the existing `chatbot-crm.html`, `templates/crm_dashboard.html`, and `real_estate_crm.py` files. Ensure the current Git branch is `feature/ai-chatbot-dashboard-integration` and pull the latest changes.

# Test Strategy:
Verify branch name using `git branch`. Check file existence and basic project structure. Run the existing Flask app to ensure it starts without errors.
