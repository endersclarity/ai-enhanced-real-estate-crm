# Task ID: 5
# Title: Update Flask App Database Connection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the Flask application code to connect to the Supabase PostgreSQL database instead of the local SQLite file.
# Details:
Update database configuration in the Flask app (e.g., SQLAlchemy connection string). Replace SQLite connection logic with PostgreSQL connection logic using the credentials obtained in Task 1. Ensure database interactions (queries, inserts, updates) are compatible with PostgreSQL syntax and features.

# Test Strategy:
Run the Flask application locally and test database operations (e.g., fetching data, adding new records) to confirm successful connection and interaction with the Supabase database.
