# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Form Validation Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a validation framework to ensure that the populated forms meet legal and business requirements. This includes checking for critical missing data and data format issues based on form field types.
# Details:
Extend the population engine or create a separate validation module. Define validation rules based on form field requirements (e.g., required fields, data format like dates or numbers). After populating a form, run validation checks. If validation fails, generate clear error messages indicating which fields have issues. This framework should integrate with the error handling mentioned in the success criteria.

# Test Strategy:
Create mock CRM data with missing required fields or invalid data formats. Run the population and validation process. Verify that the validation framework correctly identifies and reports the errors.
