# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement User Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a robust user authentication system for the CRM application.
# Details:
Integrate a secure authentication library (e.g., Flask-Login, Flask-Security) or implement a custom authentication flow. Store user credentials securely (hashed passwords). Implement user registration, login, logout, and password reset functionalities. Ensure authentication protects sensitive endpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, and logout flows. Verify that unauthenticated users cannot access protected pages. Test password reset functionality. Check for secure handling of credentials (e.g., no plain text passwords in DB).
