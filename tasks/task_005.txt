# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Gemini API Integration in Flask Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the logic in `real_estate_crm.py` to securely use the Gemini API key and make API calls to get responses for user chat messages.
# Details:
Inside the `/chat` route handler in `real_estate_crm.py`, retrieve the Gemini API key securely (e.g., from environment variables). Use a Python library (like `google-generativeai`) to interact with the Gemini API. Pass the user's message to the API and process the response. Return the AI's response to the frontend.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the function that interacts with the Gemini API, mocking the API response. Test the `/chat` endpoint by sending sample user messages. Verify that the Flask application successfully calls the Gemini API and returns a valid AI response in the expected format. Check for secure handling of the API key.
