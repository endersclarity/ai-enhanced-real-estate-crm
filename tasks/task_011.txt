# Task ID: 11
# Title: Develop Data Migration Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop tools or scripts for migrating data into the production CRM database.
# Details:
Create scripts or a simple tool to import data from external sources (e.g., spreadsheets, other databases) into the production PostgreSQL database following the `real_estate_crm_schema.sql`. Ensure data validation and error handling during migration. This is needed for initial user onboarding with existing data.

# Test Strategy:
Prepare sample data in a common format (e.g., CSV). Run the migration tool/script on a test database. Verify that the data is correctly imported and matches the source data. Test error handling with malformed data.
