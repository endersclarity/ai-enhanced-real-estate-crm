DISCLOSURE REGARDING REAL ESTATE AGENCY RELATIONSHIP 
(As required by the Civil Code) 
(C.A.R. Form AD, Revised 12/24) 

 (If checked) This form is being provided in connection with a transaction for a leasehold interest exceeding one year as per Civil Off
Code §§ 2079.13(j), (k), and (l). When you enter into a discussion with a real estate agent regarding a real estate transaction, you should from the outset understand what type of agency relationship or representation you wish to have with the agent in the transaction. 
SELLER'S AGENT 
A Seller's agent under a listing agreement with the Seller acts as the agent for the Seller only. A Seller's agent or a subagent of that agent has the following affirmative obligations: To the Seller: A Fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in dealings with the Seller. To the Buyer and the Seller: 
(a) 
Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent's duties. 

(b) 
A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith. 

(c) 
A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that are not known to, or within the diligent attention and observation of, the parties. An agent is not obligated to reveal to either party any confidential information obtained from the other party that does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above. 


BUYER'S AGENT 
A Buyer's agent can, with a Buyer's consent, agree to act as agent for the Buyer only. This includes a Buyer's agent under a buyer-broker representation agreement with the Buyer. In these situations, the agent is not the Seller's agent, even if by agreement the agent may receive compensation for services rendered, either in full or in part from the Seller. An agent acting only for a Buyer has the following affirmative obligations: To the Buyer: A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in dealings with the Buyer. To the Buyer and the Seller:
(a) 
Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent's duties. 

(b) 
A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith. 

(c) 
A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that are not known to, or within the diligent attention and observation of, the parties. An agent is not obligated to reveal to either party any confidentialinformation obtained from the other party that does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above. 


AGENT REPRESENTING BOTH SELLER AND BUYER 
A real estate agent, either acting directly or through one or more salespersons and broker associates, can legally be the agent of both the Seller and the Buyer in a transaction, but only with the knowledge and consent of both the Seller and the Buyer. In a dual agency situation, the agent has the following affirmative obligations to both the Seller and the Buyer:
(a) A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in the dealings with either the Seller or the Buyer. 
(b) Other duties to the Seller and the Buyer as stated above in their respective sections. In representing both Seller and Buyer, a dual agent may not, without the express permission of the respective party, disclose to the other party confidential information, including, but not limited to, facts relating to either the Buyer's or Seller's financial position, motivations, bargaining position, or other personal information that may impact price, including the Seller's willingness to accept a price less than the listing price or the Buyer's willingness to pay a price greater than the price offered. 
SELLER AND BUYER RESPONSIBILITIES 
Either the purchase agreement or a separate document will contain a confirmation of which agent is representing you and whether that agent is representing you exclusively in the transaction or acting as a dual agent. Please pay attention to that confirmation to make sure it accurately reflects your understanding of your agent's role. 
The above duties of the agent in a real estate transaction do not relieve a Seller or Buyer from the responsibility to protect their own interests. You should carefully read all agreements to assure that they adequately express your understanding of the transaction. A real estate agent is a person qualified to advise about real estate. If legal or tax advice is desired, consult a competent professional. 
If you are a Buyer, you have the duty to exercise reasonable care to protect yourself, including as to those facts about the property 
which are known to you or within your diligent attention and observation. Both Sellers and Buyers should strongly consider obtaining tax advice from a competent professional because the federal and state tax consequences of a transaction can be complex and subject to change. Throughout your real property transaction you may receive more than one disclosure form, depending upon the number of agentsassisting in the transaction. The law requires each agent with whom you have more than a casual relationship to present you with this disclosure form. You should read its contents each time it is presented to you, considering the relationship between you and the real estate agent in your specific transaction. This disclosure form includes the provisions of §§ 2079.13 to 2079.24, inclusive, of theCivil Code set forth on page 2. Read it carefully. 
Note: Real estate broker commissions are not set by law and are fully negotiable.

The disclosures and confirmation required by this section shall be in addition to the disclosure required by § 2079.14. An agent's duty to providedisclosure and confirmation of representation in this section may be performed by a real estate salesperson or broker associate affiliated with that broker.2079.18 (Repealed pursuant to AB-1289) 2079.19 The payment of compensation or the obligation to pay compensation to an agent by the seller or buyer is not necessarily determinative of a particular agency relationship between an agent and the seller or buyer. A listing agent and a selling agent may agree to share any compensation or commission paid, or any right to any compensation or commission for which an obligation arises as the result of a real estate transaction, and the terms of any such agreement shall not necessarily be determinative of a particular relationship. 2079.20 Nothing in this article prevents an agent from selecting, as a condition of the agent's employment, a specific form of agency relationship not specifically prohibited by this article if the requirements of § 2079.14 and § 2079.17 are complied with. 2079.21 (a) A dual agent may not, without the express permission of the seller, disclose to the buyer any confidential information obtained from the seller. 

(b) 
A dual agent may not, without the express permission of the buyer, disclose to the seller any confidential information obtained from the buyer. (c)Confidential information means facts relating to the client's financial position, motivations, bargaining position, or other personal information that may impact price, such as the seller is willing to accept a price less than the listing price or the buyer is willing to pay a price greater than the price offered. (d)This section does not alter in any way the duty or responsibility of a dual agent to any principal with respect to confidential information other than price. 2079.22 Nothing in this article precludes a seller's agent from also being a buyer's agent. If a seller or buyer in a transaction chooses to not be represented by an agent, that does not, of itself, make that agent a dual agent. 2079.23 (a) A contract between the principal and agent may be modified or altered to change the agency relationship at any time before the performanceof the act which is the object of the agency with the written consent of the parties to the agency relationship. (b) A lender or an auction company retained by a lender to control aspects of a transaction of real property subject to this part, including validating the sales price, shall not require, as a condition of receiving the lender's approval of the transaction, the homeowner or listing agent to defend or indemnify the lender or auction company from any liability alleged to result from the actions of the lender or auction company. Any clause, provision, covenant, or agreement purporting to impose an obligation to defend or indemnify a lender or an auction company in violation of this subdivision is against public policy, void, and unenforceable. 2079.24 Nothing in this article shall be construed to either diminish the duty of disclosure owed buyers and sellers by agents and their associate licensees,subagents, and employees or to relieve agents and their associate licensees, subagents, and employees from liability for their conduct in connection withacts governed by this article or for any breach of a fiduciary duty or a duty of disclosure.

If there is no appraisal contingency or the appraisal contingency has been waived or removed, then failure of the Property to appraise at the purchase price does not entitle Buyer to exercise the cancellation right pursuant to the loan contingency if Buyer is otherwise qualified for the specified loan and Buyer is able to satisfy lender's non-appraisal conditions for closing the loan. 

(2) 
Buyer is advised to investigate the insurability of the Property as early as possible, as this may be a requirement for lending.Buyer's ability to obtain insurance for the Property, including fire insurance, is part of Buyer's Insurance contingency. Failureof Buyer to obtain insurance may justify cancellation based on the Insurance contingency but not the loan contingency. 

(3) 
Buyer's contractual obligations regarding deposit, balance of down payment and closing costs are not contingencies of this Agreement, unless Otherwise Agreed.

(5) 
NO LOAN CONTINGENCY: If "No loan contingency" is checked in paragraph 3L(1), obtaining any loan specified is NOT a contingency of this Agreement. If Buyer does not obtain the loan specified, and as a result is unable to purchase the Property, Seller may be entitled to Buyer's deposit or other legal remedies. 


B. APPRAISAL: 
(1) 
This Agreement is, unless otherwise specified in paragraph 3L(2) or an attached CR-B form, contingent upon a written appraisal of the Property by a licensed or certified appraiser at no less than the amount specified in paragraph3L(2), without requiring repairs or improvements to the Property. Appraisals are often a reliable source to verify square footage of the subject Property. However, the ability to cancel based on the measurements provided in an appraisal fallswithin the Investigation of Property contingency. The appraisal contingency is solely limited to the value determined by theappraisal. For any cancellation based upon this appraisal contingency, Buyer shall Deliver a Copy of the written appraisal to Seller, upon request by Seller. 

(2) 
NO APPRAISAL CONTINGENCY: If "No appraisal contingency" is checked in paragraph 3L(2), then Buyer may not use the loan contingency specified in paragraph 3L(1) to cancel this Agreement if the sole reason for not obtaining the loan is that the appraisal relied upon by Buyer's lender values the property at an amount less than that specified in paragraph3L(2). If Buyer is unable to obtain the loan specified solely for this reason, Seller may be entitled to Buyer's deposit or other legal remedies.

BUYER'S INVESTIGATION ADVISORY (BIA PAGE 2 OF 2)

(C.A.R. Form PRBS, Revised 12/21) 
A real estate broker (Broker), whether a corporation, partnership or sole proprietorship, may represent more than one buyer or seller. This multiple representation can occur through an individual licensed as a broker or salesperson or through different individual broker's or salespersons (associate licensees) acting under the Broker's license. The associate licensees may be working out of the same or different office locations. 
Multiple Buyers: Broker (individually or through its associate licensees) may be working with many prospective buyers at the same time. These prospective buyers may have an interest in, and make offers on, the same properties. Some of these properties may be listed with Broker and some may not. Broker will not limit or restrict any particular buyer from making an offer on any particular property whether or not Broker represents other buyers interested in the same property. 
Multiple Sellers: Broker (individually or through its associate licensees) may have listings on many properties at the same time. As a result, Broker will attempt to find buyers for each of those listed properties. Some listed properties may appeal to the same prospective buyers. Some properties may attract more prospective buyers than others. Some of these prospective buyers may be represented by Broker and some may not. Broker will market all listed properties to all prospective buyers whether or not Broker has another or other listed properties that may appeal to the same prospective buyers. 
Dual Agency: If Seller is represented by Broker, Seller acknowledges that broker may represent prospective buyers of Seller's property and consents to Broker acting as a dual agent for both seller and buyer in that transaction. If Buyer is represented by Broker, buyer acknowledges that Broker may represent sellers of property that Buyer is interested in acquiring and consents to Broker acting as a dual agent for both buyer and seller with regard to that property. 
In the event of dual agency, seller and buyer agree that: a dual agent may not, without the express permission of the respective party, disclose to the other party confidential information, including, but not limited to, facts relating to either the buyer's or seller's financial position, motivations, bargaining position, or other personal information that may impact price, including the seller's willingness to accept a price less than the listing price or the buyer's willingness to pay a price greater than the price offered; and except as set forth above, a dual agent is obligated to disclose known facts materially affecting the value or desirability of the Property to both parties. 
Offers not necessarily confidential: Buyer is advised that seller or listing agent may disclose the existence, terms, or conditions of buyer's offer unless all parties and their agent have signed a written confidentiality agreement. Whether any such information is actually disclosed depends on many factors, such as current market conditions, the prevailing practice in the real estate community, the listing agent's marketing strategy and the instructions of the seller. 
Buyer and seller understand that Broker may represent more than one buyer or more than one seller and even both buyer and seller on the same transaction and consents to such relationships. 
Seller and/or Buyer acknowledges reading and understanding this Possible Representation of More Than One Buyer or Seller -Disclosure and Consent and agrees to the agency possibilities disclosed.

BUYER HOMEOWNERS' INSURANCE ADVISORY 
(C.A.R. Form BHIA, 6/24) 

1. 
IMPORTANCE OF OBTAINING PROPERTY INSURANCE: If the property you are purchasing is destroyed or damaged due to natural disaster or accident or some other event, insurance may be available to help with the cost of repair or rebuilding. In the absence of property insurance, the homeowner would be responsible for the full expense. If the property is purchased with a loan, or refinanced, the lender will require an insurance policy protecting its interest. Insurance policies can cover damage due to one or more of the following: fire, flood, earthquake and other causes. The policy or an insurance broker should be consulted to determine when coverage applies and whether a supplement or rider can be purchased to provide additional coverage or if a separate policy is necessary. 

2. 
PROPERTY INSURANCE AND PURCHASE CONTRACT TERMS: Your real estate purchase contract may contain a contingency that gives you the right to legally cancel the agreement within a specified time if you are unable to obtain or afford property insurance. This cancellation right may be a specific contingency pertaining to insurance or may be part of an overall investigation contingency. If buyer waives or removes the applicable contingency before determining the availability and cost of property insurance, buyer is acting against the advice of broker. Additionally, if the property is part of an HOA, lenders may require and buyers will want to know that the HOA has adequate insurance to cover the areas for which the HOA is responsible. 

3. 
CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTY INSURANCE MARKET: Some insurance carriers in California have stopped issuing new property insurance policies and others are limiting the number and location of new policies, due to rising replacement costs and an increase in natural disasters. These changes may affect both the availability and cost of insurance. However, over 50 insurance carriers are admitted to sell property insurance in California so it may be possible to obtain insurance even if some carriers will not write a new policy covering the property you intend to buy. An insurance broker may also be able to find a non-admitted insurance carrier offering to insure the property you intend to buy. Because locating an affordable insurance policy could take time and effort, buyers are advised to make all insurance inquiries as early in the home buying process as possible. 

4. 
INSURANCE CONDITIONS: Many insurance carriers impose physical condition standards before issuing a policy, or reserve the right to cancel policies even after they are issued, if certain minimum standards are not confirmed in an inspection or otherwise. Physical conditions standards could include, but are not limited to, prohibition of knob and tube electrical wiring, requirements related to piping/plumbing materials, standards related to the age and/or quality of the roof or foundation, minimal safety standards related to handrails, tripping hazards, and defensible space requirements. 

5. 
RESOURCES: The California Department of Insurance (DOI) maintains a website addressing Residential Home insurance. Resources on this State government webpage include: (i) Top Ten tips for Finding Residential Insurance; 

(ii) Residential Insurance Company Contact List; (iii) Home Insurance Finder; and (iv) information on other insurance issues. The webpage also includes information on how to contact the DOI, and suggestions on what to do if you cannot find insurance. The webpage and link to other documents is located at https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/105­type/5-residential/index.cfm. 

6. 
BROKER RECOMMENDATION: Buyer is advised to explore available property insurance options early in the home buying process and to consult with a qualified insurance professional of buyer's choosing to understand insurance availability and cost prior to removal of any related contingencies. Real estate brokers do not have expertise in this area.

WIRE FRAUD AND ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER ADVISORY 
(C.A.R. Form WFA, Revised 12/21) 


Property Address: 8765 Luxury Boulevard, Beverly Hills, CA 90210 (Property). 
WIRE FRAUD AND ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS ADVISORY: 
The ability to communicate and conduct business electronically is a convenience and reality in nearly all parts of our lives. At the same time, it has provided hackers and scammers new opportunities for their criminal activity. Many businesses have been victimized and the real estate business is no exception. 
While wiring or electronically transferring funds is a welcome convenience, we all need to exercise extreme caution. Emails attempting to induce fraudulent wire transfers have been received and have appeared to be legitimate. Reports indicate that some hackers have been able to intercept emailed transfer instructions, obtain account information and, by altering some of the data, redirect the funds to a different account. It also appears that some hackers were able to provide false phone numbers for verifying the wiring or funds transfer instructions. In those cases, the victim called the number provided to confirm the instructions, and then unwittingly authorized a transfer to somewhere or someone other than the intended recipient. 
ACCORDINGLY, YOU ARE ADVISED: 
1. 
Obtain phone numbers and account numbers only from Escrow Officers, Property Managers, or Landlords at the beginning of the transaction. 

2. 
DO NOT EVER WIRE OR ELECTRONICALLY TRANSFER FUNDS PRIOR TO CALLING TO CONFIRM THE TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS. ONLY USE A PHONE NUMBER YOU WERE PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY. Do not use any different phone number or account number included in any emailed transfer instructions. 

3. 
Orally confirm the transfer instruction is legitimate and confirm the bank routing number, account numbers and other codes before taking steps to transfer the funds. 

4. 
Avoid sending personal information in emails or texts. Provide such information in person or over the telephone directly to the Escrow Officer, Property Manager, or Landlord. 

5. 
Take steps to secure the system you are using with your email account. These steps include creating strong passwords, using secure WiFi, and not using free services. 


If you believe you have received questionable or suspicious wire or funds transfer instructions, immediately notify your bank, and the other party, and the Escrow Office, Landlord, or Property Manager. The sources below, as well as others, can also provide information: 
Federal Bureau of Investigation: https://www.fbi.gov/; the FBI's IC3 at www.ic3.gov; or 310-477-6565 National White Collar Crime Center: http://www.nw3c.org/ On Guard Online: https://www.onguardonline.gov/ 
NOTE: There are existing alternatives to electronic and wired fund transfers such as cashier's checks. By signing below, the undersigned acknowledge that each has read, understands and has received a copy of this Wire Fraud and Electronic Funds Transfer Advisory.

CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT ADVISORY, DISCLOSURE AND NOTICE 
(C.A.R. Form CCPA, Revised 12/22) 

The California Consumer Privacy Act (commencing with Civil Code § 1798.100) (CCPA), as amended by California voters in 2020, grants to California residents certain rights in their private, personal information (PI) that is collected by companies with whom they do business. Under the CCPA, PI is defined broadly to encompass non-public records information that could reasonably be linked directly or indirectly to you. PI could potentially include photographs of, or sales information about, your property. 
During the process of buying and selling real estate your PI will be collected and likely shared with others, including real estate licensees, a Multiple Listing Service, real estate internet websites, service providers, lenders, and title and escrow companies, to name several possibilities. Businesses that are covered by the CCPA are required to grant you various rights in your PI, including the right to know what PI is collected, the right to know what PI is sold or shared and to whom, the right to request that the business correct or delete your PI, the right to opt out or stop the transfer of your PI to others, and the right to limit the use of certain PI which is considered sensitive. You may get one or more notices regarding your CCPA rights from businesses you interact with in a real estate transaction. However, not all businesses that receive or share your PI are obligated to comply with the CCPA. Moreover, businesses that are otherwise covered under the CCPA may have a legal obligation to maintain PI, notwithstanding your instruction to the contrary. For instance, regardless of whether they are covered by CCPA, under California law, brokers and Multiple Listing Services are required to maintain their records for 3 years. If you wish to exercise your rights under CCPA, where applicable, you should contact the respective business directly. 
You can obtain more information about the CCPA and your rights under the law from the State of California Department of Justice (oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa). Additionally, the California Privacy Protection Agency is authorized to promulgate regulations which may further clarify requirements of the CCPA (cppa.ca.gov/regulations/). 
I/we acknowledge receipt of a copy of this California Consumer Privacy Act Advisory, Disclosure and Notice.
